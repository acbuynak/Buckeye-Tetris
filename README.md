# Buckeye-Tetris
Tetris @ Ohio State University

*Scott Lab Computers dislike me installing things on them...*

## STRUCTURE THEORY (ACB)

- 3 Main views to bounce between  
1. "MenuView"  
2. "LeaderBoardView"  
3. "GameView"  

Initial Boot will create window and load "MenuView".  
....Two Options: "Start Game"    --> "GameView"  
....             "Leader Board"  --> "LeaderBoardView"  

IN GAME VIEW:
....System waits for user input of any kind.. then begins playing
....
....
....

### File Saving Structure (KM) ??  
1. Game should pull from external txt/dat file for current leaderboard.  
2. Game should save to external txt/dat file for leaderboard progression.  
3. Leaderboard file updated after completion of each game
